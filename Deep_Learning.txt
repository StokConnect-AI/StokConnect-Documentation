We'll use deep learning techniques like LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) and Transformer models to analyze patient symptoms and suggest possible diseases.
Among various classification networks, this approach is especially good at handling multiple symptoms to give more accurate illness predictions. 
We'll also use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to connect symptoms, medications, and details like nearby pharmacies, creating a smarter recommendation system based on context. 
Time-series models will help us predict medicine demand and avoid running out of stock.
To make our models fit better with local conditions,we'll apply transfer learning, which adapts existing models to new environments. 
we'll set up a continuous feedback loop so the chatbot can keep learning and improving over time.
