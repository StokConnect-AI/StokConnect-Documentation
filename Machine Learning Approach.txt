Machine learning approach for demand forecasting

1.Define scope: product, category, or regional forecasting levels.
2.Use classical models for baseline: ARIMA for seasonal trends.
3.Apply advanced models for complex patterns:
  -Gradient Boosted Trees for structured sales data.
  -Random Forest when feature interactions matter.
  -LSTM or GRU for sequential time series with long-term dependencies.
4.Combine models in an ensemble to raise accuracy.
5.Apply feature selection to reduce noise.
6.Verify with cross-validation on rolling windows.
7.Observe movement in data and initiate models when accuracy drops.
8.Estimates stock needs by analyzing purchase patterns and seasonal demand.
